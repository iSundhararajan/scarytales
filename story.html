  <h2>People Under the Floor</h2>
  <p1 style="color:#8B140D">In 1870, a man was making his way through the lonely mountains of New Mexico when he
    came across a stout wood cabin tucked at the foot of the Palo Flechado pass. The owner introduced himself as Charles
    Kennedy and invited his new acquaintance inside for a meal.As Kennedy’s Ute wife served dinner, the traveler sat
    next to the couple’s young son and asked if there were other Native Americans nearby. The boy looked back at him for
    a moment and then answered: “Can’t you smell the one Papa put under the floor?”</p1>
